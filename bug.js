This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render items that contain null or undefined values within their data structure.  It often manifests as a silent failure where the list doesn't render correctly or crashes without clear error messages in the console.  The underlying issue stems from React Native's inability to efficiently handle null or undefined values when generating the list's components.
